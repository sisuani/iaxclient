=======================================================================
BUILDING THE LIBRARY: (tested on Gentoo/Ubuntu/Windows XP/Windows 7)

* Linux:
first Install dev tools (gcc, cmake, make, ..)
Install openal

- Iaxclient:
cd lib
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

* Windows:
first Install mingw and cmake
Download openal, compile (cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .. ; make); copy dll to lib path (ex: c:\mingw32\i686-w64-ming32\lib\)

- Iaxclient:
cd lib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
mingw32-make -f Makefile

In addition to including libiax, IAXCLIENT is also based in part on code
included in test clients within libiax itself.

The included sub-libraries, including libiax, libiax2, gsm, portaudio,
and the sox-derived filters, were developed by others, as noted in above
and in their sources.  We couldn't have built IAXCLIENT (or, it would
have been much more difficult!) without the great work from these
projects.

=======================================================================
LIBRARY ORGANIZATION/DESIGN/CODING CONVENTION NOTES

The iaxclient library is designed to be a small, simple library that
encapsulates all that you need in order to make IAX protocol telephony
programs.

All exported symbols should be prefixed with "iaxc_", to avoid namespace
collisions/pollution in programs using this library.

The header file "iaxclient.h" should contain those declarations needed
by client programs, but not rely on other headers (i.e. those from
included libraries).  The "iaxclient-lib.h" header file is the main
header file for the library's internal declarations.


=========================================================================

CODECS

The codec API is pretty straightforward; just use any of the existing
available codecs as a guide.  The only place in the main code they
interface is the switch in audio_encode.c:create_codec

ILBC

Lots of people are enamored with iLBC lately, so I put this together for
them.  Personally, I prefer speex, because it seems to sound just as
good, but has no license restrictions.  With proper compilation options
(i.e. use it's SSE optimizations), it can be made even faster than the
iLBC reference.

There is glue to build iaxclient with iLBC available in the source, but
the source to iLBC itself is _not_ included.  This is primarily because
of the licensing issues.

I'm not a lawyer, but it appears that iLBC's license would make it
impossible to build iaxclient and link it with a GPL front-end, meaning
a library built this way is no longer something that could be considered
LGPL.  However, you could probably build a client using iLBC and
distribute it legally, if you follow the rules in the LGPL.  So, this is
an issue for you and your legal counsel to figure out.

To actually build iaxclient with iLBC, though is very easy.  Just make a
directory under lib named iLBC, and drop the iLBC reference sources into
it, then change CODEC_ILBC=0 to CODEC_ILBC=1 in the Makefile, and away
you go.

The source presently is set up for the draft-5 version.
